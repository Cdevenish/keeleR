## My second r script ##########


##### Part 2. Creating a project organisation  in R #############

## Create a folder on your computer that will be the working directory of your project.
## Call the folder 'Intro_Project' - save it in a sensible place (e.g. your module folder, in Documents)

## Inside your *Intro_project* folder, now create the following *folders*:


# *Intro_project* (Project folder - working directory)
# | Readme.txt
# |
# |---*inData*
# |       |
# |       |--- data guide
# |       |--- data files
# |
# |---*scripts*
# |       |
# |       |--- script files
# |
# |---*outData*
# |       |
# |       |--- data files
# |
# |---*plots*
# |       |
# |       |--- plot images
# |
# |---*docs*
# |       |
# |       |--- documents
# |       |--- text files
#


# If you're not sure how this works, have a look at the template on the KLE - "simple_project.zip".

# Include a readME.txt file in the main folder:
# Check out what should go in this section at the Project Tier webpage:
# https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/protocol-4-0/root/readme/
#
# At a minimum:
#
# 1.
# Project name
# Project team
# Software used + packages, platform (e.g. windows, mac)
#
# 2.
# Map of your project structure and what each folder contains
#
# 3.
# Instructions for reproducing your work

# You should also provide a text file giving the sources and information about your input data, e.g. units, citations, etc.
# See here for more information:
# https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/protocol-4-0/root/data/originaldata/metadata/metadataguide/

## Now that you have the structure, download the "arthropods.csv" from the KLE and it to your inData.
## Then download the arthropod analysis and add it to your scripts folder.
